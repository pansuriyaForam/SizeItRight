## 💡 Why this exists

Most tools **compress** images.  
Some tools **resize** dimensions.  
But few let you say, "**Hey, I need this image to be 50 KB. Period.**"

**SizeItRight** was built for that very real pain every student, job applicant, and freelancer faces.

---

## 🧠 How it works

- Uses smart image processing (Sharp + Firebase) under the hood
- Dynamically adjusts image quality to match **target KB range**
- **Runs in-memory** — never saves your files
- Just you, your image, and the result

---

## 👨‍🔬 Ideal Use Cases

- Uploading **passport photos** to government portals  
- College application forms with **strict image limits**  
- Resizing **scanned documents** for PDF submission  
- Freelancers meeting **portfolio upload specs**  
- Anyone tired of **trial-and-error image compression**

- 🔒 We **do not store** your images  
- 🧾 We **don’t require login**  
- 📬 We **don’t spam** your inbox
